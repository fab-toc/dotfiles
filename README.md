# dotfiles

This directory contains the dotfiles of my system. As for now, I actually use fish for my shell and fisher for my plugin manager.

##Â Requirements

To install those dotfiles, make sure you have the following packages installed (the commands used are available on Debian-based distros) :

### Git

```
sudo apt install git
```

### Stow
```
sudo apt install stow
```

### Fish shell
```
sudo apt install fish
```

## Installation

### Auto-install script

To install this configuration, you can use the install.sh script provided. Just use the following (with root permissions !) :
```
sudo ./install.sh
```

### Manual Installation
